      <h1>Assignment 01 - BAR CHARTS, CLUSTERED BAR CHARTS + STACKED BAR CHARTS</h1>

    <div class="bio">
        <p> bar charts, according to A Abuela's <a href="http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html">diagram</a>, bar charts are best utilized when the visualization is showing a comparison among items with one variable per item, few categories and few items. </p>

      <h3>What are the limitations of the project?</h3>

        <h3> Point of View </h3>
        <p>"The image below shows the first published bar chart, created by William Playfair in 1781. The creation of this chart was inspired by Joseph Priestley's 1765 timeline charts. Playfair utlized this type of chart, because he was lacking time series-data. According to Beniger and Robyn, "His bar chart was the first quantitative graphic form that did not locate data either in space (as did coordinated and tables) or tieme (as did Priestley's time-lines). It constitutes a pure solutions ot the problem of disrete quantitative comparison."</p>

               <h3>CONTENT</h3>
               <li>Lives ended by gun death are referred to as "stolen"</li>
               <li>The visualization summarizes the total years of 'stolen life' due to gun deaths in the USA as a single number </li>
               <li>The <i>What This Data Reveals </i> section refers to the disproportionate impact on males and young people. The interactive features would have allowed the user to discover this on their own, but it is presented as a default. </li>
          </div>

          <div class="col span_1_of_2">
              <h3>DESIGN</h3>
              <li>Individual lives are represented as arcs in the infographic, evoking the long arc of a life and lived experience</li>
              <li>Arcs of individual gun death victims are filled gray when the individual died, suggesting a loss or a 'stealing' of life </li>
              <li>All gun death arcs are represented cumulatively, giving a sense of the volume of 'stolen' life </li>

   		 <h3>Does it achieve everything it set out to do? (No)</h3>
    		<p>When using the filter system, the curves for the selected demographic move above the axis and all other victims move below. The quantity of curves does not appear to be accurately correlated, visually, to the percentages of victims on display.</p>

            <h3>CONS</h3>
             <ol>
                <li><p>No legend to explain the gradient yellow color of the curves (we suspect it's to make the overlapping curves legible, but it's not actually explained):</p>

                <li>Difficult to compare the graphs among different filters to reach further conclusions.
                 </li>
                <li>Ambiguous and loaded words like "People Killed" and "Stolen Years" doesn't explain difference between 2010 dataset (homicides) and 2013 dataset (suicides & homicides).
