        <p> Bar charts, according to A. Abuela's <a href="http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html">diagram</a>, bar charts are best utilized when the visualization is showing a comparison among items with one variable per item, few categories and few items. </p>

    	  		  <p><img class="limitImage" src="Images/1.png"></p>
      <br>
      <p>The image above shows the first published bar chart, created by William Playfair in 1781. The creation of this chart was inspired by Joseph Priestley's 1765 timeline charts. Playfair utlized this type of chart, because he was lacking time series-data. According to Beniger and Robyn, "His bar chart was the first quantitative graphic form that did not locate data either in space (as did coordinated and tables) or tieme (as did Priestley's time-lines). It constitutes a pure solutions ot the problem of disrete quantitative comparison.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>The problem with this <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-27-worst-charts-of-all-time-2013-6#i-never-thought-it-was-possible-but-i-actually-understand-soccer-less-after-looking-at-this-chart-3">graph</a> is that it does not start at zero, making it difficult to accurately see the changes between provinces in Canada:</p>

With so many categories, it makes it very confusing for the reader.</p>

             <ol>
                <li><p>Good examples of bar graphs are the ones that have 0 as a starting point, have clear colours and are two dimentional.
